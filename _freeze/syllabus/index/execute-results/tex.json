This course emphasizes telling stories about cities using a set of descriptive approaches, quantitative and spatial analysis in R. We will learn how to describe community characteristics with small area census data, work with local administrative data, and think about how our analysis of quantitative data fit with other forms of data and engagement to fill in gaps in knowledge.\n\nLearning objectives:\n\n-   Gain familiarity with R as a data analysis, mapping, and storytelling tool.\n-   Be able to identify relevant open datasets in support of your research question.\n-   Articulate the main arguments for your data analysis product and how it supports planning and decision-making regarding an issue of local/national significance.\n\n### How Will We Be Learning\n\nWe will be covering census data analysis, using a variable mixture of approachable lectures and hands-on lab tutorials.\n\n**Lecture/Discussion:** Introduces and discusses key concepts, debates, and use cases of urban data science.\n\n**Lab:** We will provide data science tutorials using R. Each lab tutorial aims to solve a specific urban data science problem in addition to building coding skills and statistical intuition. You will need to complete the labs for credits, and you should feel free to apply any parts of these scripts to your own projects.\n\n**Extension readings:** We provide a light material list that focuses on specific topics each week. These articles help you to reflect on your work and formulate arguments for your projects.\n\n**Urban data science project:** This is your final assignment for this course. You can bring any topics, or questions that you might have been grappling with into this course and explore them using the data science skills covered in this course. You will then either self-organize into teams or work individually towards your proposed products.\n\n### Your Data Science Project\n\nFor this project, you will apply any analysis or visualization methods covered in the course to the topic/issue/geography that is of interest to you. This could be an extension to one or more of your lab exercises. It could be a focused study of conditions (e.g., population change, transportation equity) that you would like to explore more through data integration and visualization. It could be an argument that you want to make (e.g., where should the city plant new trees) and see whether data can provide you with more information or evidence. We will organize a presentation in the last week of class.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nStudents will also benefit from some prior knowledge working in R and RStudio, however, this is also not a course prerequisite. Due to time constraints, I won't be able to introduce the very basic R (software installation, data types, etc.), but [these two tutorials](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1) should provide you with sufficient knowledge to start with this course.\n\n### Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n### Key Logistics\n\n**Lab Exercises:** Due Tuesday, end of day\n\nYou will be working on lab on most Wednesday classes and submit a short report before the subsequent class. Details will be specified in each of the assignments distributed at the beginning of the lab session.\n\n**Package Introduction:** Monday, Nov 13, and Monday 20, in class\n\nEach student is expected to introduce a package (or two) that is relevant to your research interests during a class session. The objectives are (1) to foster a collaborative approach to acquiring familiarity with the ever-increasing new packages, and (2) to identify valuable existing R packages applicable to your study and research.\n\n**Project Scope Memo:** Due Friday, Nov 17.\n\nThe purpose of this memo is to communicate the scope of your project (what you will do) and your strategies for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing data (how you will do it). A separate guideline will be distributed at the beginning of the course.\n\n**Project Presentation:** Week 8 (Dec 11 -- Dec 13), class time.\n\n### Late policy\n\nTo keep all students on a relatively level playing field, a late assignment will be accepted up until one week after the original due date for a loss of one letter grade (e.g., an A becomes an B). After that point, late assignments will receive no credit and will not be accepted.\n\n### Software\n\nWe use R and R Studio as the coding environment to develop analysis and applications. You can install the software on your personal computers from [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).\n\n### Communication\n\nPlan on using our class Slack channel, email, and office hours to get help with troubleshooting problems as they arise in your work. I also encourage you to work with others in the class to troubleshoot problems - it is highly likely that others in the class have encountered similar problems, and this also allows us to create a repository of our problems and responses.\n\n**Email:** I check emails quite frequently, but I will not always be able to respond to emails right away. Please plan accordingly so that you don't miss deadlines.\n\n**Slack:** We will set up a Slack workspace for general communication including Q&A, project collaboration, and information exchange.\n\n**Office hours:** Please consult the top of the syllabus for specific times. I will announce if there are any changes or exceptions. I'm happy to answer any specific coding questions, or chat and help shape the objective and scope of your projects.\n\n### Ethics\n\n**Academic Integrity:** Violations to academic integrity are unacceptable at MIT and DUSP. [Instances of misconduct](http://integrity.mit.edu/)include but are not limited to plagiarism, cheating, deliberately unauthorized use of course data and material.\n\n**Collaboration Policy:** While team collaboration is encouraged, students should specify their role and tasks in a team. A positive and constructive attitude for teamwork is essential for a successful completion of the course.\n\n**Diversity and Inclusion:** MIT highly values a diverse, friendly, respectful, and inclusive learning environment among students, faculty, and staffs. We welcome all individuals disregarding their origin, citizenship, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious and pollical beliefs. Please contact me or departmental staffs if you have any question / consideration regarding this.\n\n### Schedule\n\n#### W01 (Oct 23 - Oct 27): What Does Urban Data Science Do\n\n**Lecture:** Introduces the context of using computer science approaches in city planning and explores contemporary challenges of addressing complex, often political, unequal and 'wicked' planning challenges with new computational and data-analytic tools.\n\n**Lab:** We will be setting up our computing environment and introducing R as a data-wrangling, plotting, and mapping language.\n\n**Readings:**\n\n-   Boeing, G., Batty, M., Jiang, S., and Schweitzer, L.
