This practice exercise provides some more structured exploration and practice with Quarto Document (R Markdown format). We will mix Markdown sections with code chunks, build familiarity with basic data types, and experiment with importing a tabular dataset. Because this is an in-class exercise, there is nothing you need to submit---the goal is to apply what we have read and seen in the lectures.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Practice formatting text with Quarto

After you download today's lab folder, launch RStudio by double clicking the "lab1.Rproj" file. Go to **File - New File - Quarto Document** to create a new Quarto document. The prompt shown below will appear. Type in a document title and your name.

![](../img/lab1_quarto.PNG){width="450"}

You will see a template file. At the very top of the notebook we have the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) or "Yet Another Markdown Language" header which begins and ends with three dashes `---`. At the very least, it specifies the title, author and output format when the document is rendered. There can be other options specified in the YAML, particularly if you are rendering to a format other than HTML (see [the reading](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-formats.html) from this week).

Let's add another line to the YAML header:

> date: \<insert the date that the file is created\>.

Below the YAML is where the Markdown sections typically begin. The interface looks pretty much like a Word document. There is a toolbar that allows you to make bold or italic text, create a bullet list, insert a link or an image, insert a code block, etc.

On the very left of this toolbar, click the **"Source"** button to switch Markdown editing mode. These are sections of text that usually explain or contextualize the code and graphics and are formatted using [Markdown syntax](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf). For example:

-   #: a header element.
-   \*\*: bold text.
-   \*: italic text.
-   \` : code blocks.

### Your practice

In 2014, the City of Cambridge passed a local ordinance on building energy use disclosure. Spend a few moments reviewing [this website](https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/zoninganddevelopment/sustainabledevelopment/buildingenergydisclosureordinance) to become familiar with the ordinance (in general). Then, add 3-5 sentences below your YAML section that explain---in your own words---the following:

-   What Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance is about?
-   What does the ordinance require?
-   Why do advocates argue that building energy use disclosure is desirable?

You may edit your text either in the **"Source"** or **"Visual"** panel, or switch them back and forth to get familiar with both. Make sure to make gratuitous use of bold, italics, etc. in your text. You have access to the "Markdown Quick Reference" directly from RStudio (**Help - Markdown Quick Reference**).

Now you should **Save**. RStudio will guide you to save the file in the folder where your "Rproj" file is. Then click the **"Render"** button on top of your toolbar (or click Ctrl+Shift+K) to render the current document. The document is rendered by the [`knitr` package](https://yihui.org/knitr/). You can immediately see your nicely formatted document in a web browser.

# Insert a video

You've probably noticed there is a video on the Cambridge webpage. Let's assume that the video hosted on that webpage might be useful for others who view our rendered document. We can insert the video in Quarto and it will render in the output when we knit the document. All you need to do is open the embed code for the video itself (i.e., right-click the video - Copy the embed code), then copy-and-paste it into your Markdown section in the **"Source"** panel.

![](../img/lab1_youtube.PNG)

What we have above is HTML code. A quick explanation without going into lots of detail:

-   The \<iframe\> tag is what inserts the video (or another document) in line with the Markdown text.
-   The src attribute provides the URL for the video
-   The remaining attributes outline the specifics of how the video will appear.

For our purposes, the most important of these attributes is **data-external="1"**. This attribute is typically **NOT SPECIFIED** in the embed code you find on the web by default and **YOU WILL NEED TO ADD IT** in order for video content to render in your output. This attribute is currently required for the `knitr` package to properly render video content.

### Your practice

Embed this video in your Markdown section after the introductory sentences you have written. Knit your notebook again and inspect your work.

# Download and read data

As you know, the other component of a Quarto Document is code chunks. Recall that code chunks are where the R code lives in a notebook. These are easy to spot as shaded blocks leading by {r} as shown below. (In the Source panel, they always have three backticks followed by {r}).

```{r}
1 + 1
```

In accordance with the ordinance, the City maintains BEUDO data for individual properties from 2015-2021. You can view the data on the [Cambridge Open Data Portal](https://data.cambridgema.gov/Energy-and-the-Environment/Cambridge-Building-Energy-and-Water-Use-Data-Discl/72g6-j7aq/). Take a few moments to explore the dataset by scrolling down the page and viewing the "Columns in this Dataset" and "Table Preview" sections in particular. Now **download this dataset in CSV format and save it in your "data" folder**, which is already created within your project folder.

Insert a code chunk in your Quarto document by going to **Code - Insert Chunk**. I usually use the shortcut key RStudio provides (Alt+Ctrl+I). Type a few things in the chunk and make it look like the following:

```{verbatim}
{r label="loadtidyverse", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The `label` option is not required, but can be helpful when you render the notebook (otherwise you will see "unnamed-chunk" in the Render tab next to the Console tab). The other options (described [in greater detail here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)) suppress all warnings and messages that might otherwise appear in the rendered HTML output, making it unnecessarily cluttered and hard to read.

Run this code chunk to load `tidyverse` package. You can either click the green triangle on the top-right of this chunk, or use Ctrl+Enter.

### Your practice

In your Console, type in `?readr::read_csv` and hit Enter. Review the documentation for `read_csv` paying special attention to the "Arguments" and "Examples" sections of the help page. Note that the double colon above tells us that the function `read_csv` is located within the `readr` package, which happens to be part of the `tidyverse` suite of R packages.

1.  **Insert a new code chunk and write a line of code that imports your data stored in the .csv file and assigns it to an object called `energy`.**

2.  **Use the `colnames()` function to get a quick sense of the column names of this dataset.**

```{r include=FALSE}
energy <- read_csv("../data/Cambridge_Building_Energy_and_Water_Use_Data_Disclosure_2015-2021.csv")
```

Run your code chunks. You will be able to see in the rendered output the dimensions of the dataset (always written as rows x columns), the names of the columns, and the data type of each column.

# Key `dplyr` functions

`dplyr` is a popular R package for data manipulation and transformation. It provides a set of functions that make it easier to work with data frames and data tables in R. Explore more of `dplyr` functionality described [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [here](https://info201.github.io/dplyr.html). We are going to practice some essentials:

## `Select`: selects a subset of **columns.**

While in base R, we do:

`dataset[, c("Column1", "Column2")]`

In `dplyr`, we do:

`dataset |> select(Column1, Column2)`

In other words, we can simply insert the column names into the `select` function, without worrying about syntax like indexing, concatenation (`c()`), and the quotation marks.

In the `energy` dataset, we probably don't need all of the 46 columns. So we can make it a smaller dataset by specifying a few columns to keep. **Insert a new code chunk in your document like this one below.** Here we are using the pipe `|>` operator to "chain together" lines of code. You can type this symbol in using Shift+Ctrl/Command+M.

```{r label="select", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
energy <- energy |>
  select(
    `Data Year`,
    `BEUDO Category`,
    Owner,
    `Year Built`,
    `Primary Property Type - Self Selected`,
    `Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)`,
    `Total GHG Emissions Intensity (kgCO2e/ft2)`,
    Longitude,
    Latitude
  ) 
```

Some of the column names are surrounded by backticks (\`), that's because they include special characters or spaces, which deviate from standard naming conventions. The use of backticks is a means of preserving these unique naming attributes. Just keep typing the column names, dplyr will populate the correct names for you.

## `filter`: Select a subset of **rows**

In base R, we do this to pick observations by their values:

`dataset[dataset$place == “Boston", ]`

In `dplyr`, we do:

`dataset |> filter(place == “Boston")`

Again, a simpler and more understandable syntax.

Now let's create a new dataset that only contains energy use records from MIT buildings and that are not missing the total GHG emission attribute. Take a look at how we achieve this using the following code, then proceed to **insert a new code chunk in your document like the one below**:

```{r label="createMITdata", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mit_energy <- energy |> 
  filter(Owner == "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY") |> 
  filter(!is.na(`Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)`))
```

## `mutate`: create or modify columns

We can change the values in a column either based on specified values or certain transformations. For example, below we are showing how to replace the full name of the institute with "MIT".

```{r label="mutate_1", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mit_energy |> mutate(Owner = "MIT")
```

You can also use `mutate` to add new columns to your data frame that are calculated from existing columns. Here we are showing how to create a new column for building ages.

```{r label="mutate_2", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mit_energy |> mutate(Building_Age = 2023 - `Year Built`)
```

**There is** **no `<-` operator** in these two code chunks. We are observing the results but the resulting tables **are not saved** in an object.

## Group_by + Summarise

`Summarise` is usually used in conjunction with `group_by` because the latter changes the scope from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. Go ahead and run the following code:

```{r label=annual_count, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mit_energy |> 
  group_by(`Data Year`) |> 
  summarise(count = n())
```

We use `group_by` such that observations (i.e., rows) are grouped according to `Data Year`, which is the year when the energy record was taken. The result is then passed to `summarise` to generate a **total number of records** per year. By default, the `n()` function creates a new attribute (i.e., column), which we here name as "count".  

Below we are using the same `group_by` + `summarise` chain to calculate the average GHG emissions of all buildings, and the average GHG emission intensity (use the column `Total GHG Emissions Intensity (kgCO2e/ft2)`). Note that we are now giving new names to each of the new columns.

```{r label=annual_mean, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mit_energy |> 
  group_by(year = `Data Year`) |> 
  summarise(count = n(),
            avg_emission = mean(`Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)`),
            avg_intensity = mean(`Total GHG Emissions Intensity (kgCO2e/ft2)`))
```

### Your practice

**Insert a few new code chunks below this one to document your code and show your results.** 

1.  From the `mit_energy` dataset, create a subset of all **non-residential** buildings, which were built **before the year 2000**. (**Hint:** which function would you use?). How many such buildings are there?

2.  From the `mit_energy` dataset, compare the GHG emissions by property type (**Hint:** which column has that information?), and generate a table that shows the following results:

    ![](../img/lab1_table.PNG){width="600"}

You can create this table mostly by modifying the last code chunk (labeled "annual_mean"), however, there are a few small things you can experiment on:

-   The calculated average numbers in this table are rounded to 2 decimals, how to achieve that?
-   The table is arranged in descending order based on the "avg_emission" column, how to do that? ([Hint](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html))

We are already trying to ask questions and find hints of interesting stories from the dataset, which is what Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is all about. If the results so far look interesting/surprising/expected to you, write a few sentences describing what you see from the analysis.

3.  Lastly, we will insert a map to complete your working document! This dataset includes "Longitude" and "Latitude" columns, which I like because it indicates that location information is available and can be visualized.

    Add the following code to your document, and you should be able to run it and see a map. (If your R says it can't find `mapview`, run the line `install.packages("mapview")`)

```{r label=mapview, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("mapview")
library(mapview)
mapview(
  mit_energy,
  xcol = "Longitude", ycol = "Latitude",
  crs = 4326,
  grid = FALSE
)
```

Now **Save**, **Render** your document again. You have now created a pretty, multi-media document using R!

In this lab we have introduced how to create and develop a Quarto Document. We have also introduced some commonly-used `dplyr` funtions including `select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `group_by` and `summarise`. This is the beginning of our data wrangling and leads to the work in Week 2.
