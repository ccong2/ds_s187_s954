    "text": "This practice exercise provides some more structured exploration and practice with Quarto Document (R Markdown format). We will mix Markdown sections with code chunks, build familiarity with basic data types, and experiment with importing a tabular dataset. Because this is an in-class exercise, there is nothing you need to submit‚Äîthe goal is to apply what we have read and seen in the lectures.\n\nPractice formatting text with Quarto\nAfter you download today‚Äôs lab folder, launch RStudio by double clicking the ‚Äúlab1.Rproj‚Äù file. Go to File - New File - Quarto Document to create a new Quarto document. The prompt shown below will appear. Type in a document title and your name.\n\nYou will see a template file. At the very top of the notebook we have the YAML or ‚ÄúYet Another Markdown Language‚Äù header which begins and ends with three dashes ---. At the very least, it specifies the title, author and output format when the document is rendered. There can be other options specified in the YAML, particularly if you are rendering to a format other than HTML (see the reading from this week).\nLet‚Äôs add another line to the YAML header:\n\ndate: &lt;insert the date that the file is created&gt;.\n\nBelow the YAML is where the Markdown sections typically begin. The interface looks pretty much like a Word document. There is a toolbar that allows you to make bold or italic text, create a bullet list, insert a link or an image, insert a code block, etc.\nOn the very left of this toolbar, click the ‚ÄúSource‚Äù button to switch Markdown editing mode. These are sections of text that usually explain or contextualize the code and graphics and are formatted using Markdown syntax. For example:\n\n#: a header element.\n**: bold text.\n*: italic text.\n` : code blocks.\n\n\nYour practice\nIn 2014, the City of Cambridge passed a local ordinance on building energy use disclosure. Spend a few moments reviewing this website to become familiar with the ordinance (in general). Then, add 3-5 sentences below your YAML section that explain‚Äîin your own words‚Äîthe following:\n\nWhat Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance is about?\nWhat does the ordinance require?\nWhy do advocates argue that building energy use disclosure is desirable?\n\nYou may edit your text either in the ‚ÄúSource‚Äù or ‚ÄúVisual‚Äù panel, or switch them back and forth to get familiar with both. Make sure to make gratuitous use of bold, italics, etc. in your text. You have access to the ‚ÄúMarkdown Quick Reference‚Äù directly from RStudio (Help - Markdown Quick Reference).\nNow you should Save. RStudio will guide you to save the file in the folder where your ‚ÄúRproj‚Äù file is. Then click the ‚ÄúRender‚Äù button on top of your toolbar (or click Ctrl+Shift+K) to render the current document. The document is rendered by the knitr package. You can immediately see your nicely formatted document in a web browser.\n\n\n\nInsert a video\nYou‚Äôve probably noticed there is a video on the Cambridge webpage. Let‚Äôs assume that the video hosted on that webpage might be useful for others who view our rendered document. We can insert the video in Quarto and it will render in the output when we knit the document. All you need to do is open the embed code for the video itself (i.e., right-click the video - Copy the embed code), then copy-and-paste it into your Markdown section in the ‚ÄúSource‚Äù panel.\n\nWhat we have above is HTML code. A quick explanation without going into lots of detail:\n\nThe &lt;iframe&gt; tag is what inserts the video (or another document) in line with the Markdown text.\nThe src attribute provides the URL for the video\nThe remaining attributes outline the specifics of how the video will appear.\n\nFor our purposes, the most important of these attributes is data-external=‚Äú1‚Äù. This attribute is typically NOT SPECIFIED in the embed code you find on the web by default and YOU WILL NEED TO ADD IT in order for video content to render in your output. This attribute is currently required for the knitr package to properly render video content.\n\nYour practice\nEmbed this video in your Markdown section after the introductory sentences you have written. Knit your notebook again and inspect your work.\n\n\n\nDownload and read data\nAs you know, the other component of a Quarto Document is code chunks. Recall that code chunks are where the R code lives in a notebook. These are easy to spot as shaded blocks leading by {r} as shown below. (In the Source panel, they always have three backticks followed by {r}).\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nIn accordance with the ordinance, the City maintains BEUDO data for individual properties from 2015-2021. You can view the data on the¬†Cambridge Open Data Portal.¬†Take a few moments to explore the dataset by scrolling down the page and viewing the ‚ÄúColumns in this Dataset‚Äù and ‚ÄúTable Preview‚Äù sections in particular. Now download this dataset in CSV format and save it in your ‚Äúdata‚Äù folder, which is already created within your project folder.\nInsert a code chunk in your Quarto document by going to Code - Insert Chunk. I usually use the shortcut key RStudio provides (Alt+Ctrl+I). Type a few things in the chunk and make it look like the following:\n{r label=\"loadtidyverse\", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nThe label option is not required, but can be helpful when you render the notebook (otherwise you will see ‚Äúunnamed-chunk‚Äù in the Render tab next to the Console tab). The other options (described in greater detail here) suppress all warnings and messages that might otherwise appear in the rendered HTML output, making it unnecessarily cluttered and hard to read.\nRun this code chunk to load tidyverse package. You can either click the green triangle on the top-right of this chunk, or use Ctrl+Enter.\n\nYour practice\nIn your Console, type in ?readr::read_csv and hit Enter. Review the documentation for read_csv paying special attention to the ‚ÄúArguments‚Äù and ‚ÄúExamples‚Äù sections of the help page. Note that the double colon above tells us that the function read_csv is located within the readr package, which happens to be part of the tidyverse suite of R packages.\n\nInsert a new code chunk and write a line of code that imports your data stored in the .csv file and assigns it to an object called energy.\nUse the colnames() function to get a quick sense of the column names of this dataset.\n\nRun your code chunks. You will be able to see in the rendered output the dimensions of the dataset (always written as rows x columns), the names of the columns, and the data type of each column.\n\n\n\nExamine a subset of your data\nWe can also explore some of the tidyverse package functionality described here and here. Take another look at this, then proceed to insert a new code chunk like the one below:\n\nmit_energy &lt;- energy |&gt; \n  filter(Owner == \"MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\") |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(`Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)`))\n\nThe above code uses the pipe |&gt; operator to ‚Äúchain together‚Äù lines of code. You can type it in using Shift+Ctrl+M.\nOur code above uses the filter function from the dplyr package (which is also part of tidyverse suite) to create a new dataset that only contains energy use records from MIT buildings that are not missing the total GHG emission attribute.\nNow we are going to create some summary data using the MIT_energy dataset. Go ahead and create another code chunk like the one below:\n\nmit_energy |&gt; \n  group_by(`Data Year`) |&gt; \n  summarise(count = n())\n\n# A tibble: 7 √ó 2\n  `Data Year` count\n        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1        2015   129\n2        2016   134\n3        2017   130\n4        2018   134\n5        2019   111\n6        2020   115\n7        2021   138\n\n\nWe use dplyr::group_by¬†function applied to it such that observations (i.e., rows) are grouped according to the value of this attribute, then the result is passed to the¬†dplyr::summarise¬†function to generate a total number of records per year. By default, the¬†n()¬†function generates a new attribute (i.e., column), which we here name as ‚Äúcount‚Äù. ¬†\nBecause there is no¬†&lt;-¬†operator, the resulting table is displayed but¬†it is not stored¬†in an object that we can go back to later.\nWe can use the same group_by + summarise chain to calculate the total GHG emissions per year, just by identifying the right column to summarise. Note that we are now giving a new name to the year column too.\n\nmit_energy |&gt; \n  group_by(year = `Data Year`) |&gt; \n  summarise(count = n(),\n            total_emission = sum(`Total GHG Emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)`))\n\n# A tibble: 7 √ó 3\n   year count total_emission\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  2015   129        204461.\n2  2016   134        193679.\n3  2017   130        198031.\n4  2018   134        197218.\n5  2019   111        168946.\n6  2020   115        160568.\n7  2021   138        195230.\n\n\n\nYour practice\n\nModify the last code chunk to add more summary results for all MIT buildings. In a new code chunk, please display a table that shows the following results:\n\n\nthe total number of reports per year,\nthe total GHG emission per year,\nthe average GHG emissions (divide your total_emission by count),\nand the average GHG emission intensity (use the column Total GHG Emissions Intensity (kgCO2e/ft2)).\n\nYour table should look like something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe mentioned that our resulting table is only displayed but not stored, now in your code chunk, add summary_data &lt;- to store your output as a new object. Run the code and you should now see this object in RStudio Environment panel.\n\nIf you used the same column name as our example, you should be able to directly run the subsequent code chunk and plot the emission stats over the years! (We will talk more about plotting so don‚Äôt worry if it now looks unfamiliar).\n\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot(summary_data)+\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avg_emission))+\n  ggtitle(\"MIT buildings average GHG emissions (Metric Tons CO2e)\")\n  \nplot2 &lt;- ggplot(summary_data)+\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = avg_intensity))+\n  ggtitle(\"MIT buildings average GHG emission intensity (kgCO2e/ft2)\")\n\nrequire(gridExtra)\ngrid.arrange(plot1, plot2, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\nDoes this graph look interesting/surprising/expected to you? What else do you want to know if you want to delve deeper into this topic? To complete your working document, please write a few sentences describing your thoughts through analyzing this dataset. Now Save, Render it again, and Celebrate!\n------\nIn this lab we have introduced how to create and develop a Quarto Document. We have also introduced some commonly-used dplyr funtions including filter, group_by and summarise. This is a soft introduction to dplyr and data wrangling in advance of the main event in Week 2."

    "text": "Description\nUrban data science draws upon statistics, visualization, and computation to better understand and ultimately shape cities. This course emphasizes telling stories about cities using a set of descriptive approaches, quantitative and spatial analysis in R. We will learn how to describe community characteristics with small area census data, work with local administrative data, and think about how our analysis of quantitative data fit with other forms of data and engagement to fill in gaps in knowledge.\nLearning objectives:\n\nGain familiarity with R as a data analysis, mapping, and storytelling tool.\nBe able to identify relevant open datasets in support of your research question.\nArticulate the main arguments for your data analysis product and how it supports planning and decision-making regarding an issue of local/national significance.\n\n\n\nHow Will We Be Learning\nLecture: Class meetings are generally divided into lecture (Mondays) and laboratory sessions (Wednesdays) that focus on concepts and hand-on applications, respectively.\nLab: We will provide data science tutorials using R. Each lab tutorial aims to solve a specific urban data science problem in addition to building coding skills. Lab reports are due before the subsequent lab period and should be written independently.\nExtension readings: We provide a light material list that focuses on specific topics each week. These resources are meant to expand your knowledge and enhance your project completion capabilities.\nUrban data science project: The term project for the course will focus on integrating the tools of data science to explore a specific real-world planning issue or research question. This is a group project and students will define the scope of the project and identify specific deliverable(s) early in the semester. Reproducing an existing analysis or study using different data or an alternate study area is also acceptable for the term project.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis is a relatively fast-paced course so students can benefit from some prior knowledge working in R and RStudio. However, this is not a course prerequisite. Our first course sessions will focus on ensuring that we are all familiar with some of the basic work environment and methods which we‚Äôll make use of over the semester.\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nLab Reports\nPackage Introduction\nProject Scope Memo\nProject Presentation\nAttendance\n40%\n10%\n10%\n30%\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Logistics\nLab Exercises: You will be working on lab on most Wednesday classes and submit a short report before the subsequent class. Details will be specified in each of the assignments distributed at the beginning of the lab session.\nPackage Introduction: Each student is expected to introduce one package to the class that is relevant to your research interests. The objectives are (1) to foster a collaborative approach to acquiring familiarity with the ever-increasing new packages, and (2) to identify valuable existing R packages applicable to your study. A separate guideline will be distributed at the beginning of the course.\nProject Scope Memo: Due Friday, Nov 17.\nThe purpose of this memo is to communicate the scope of your project (what you will do) and your strategies for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing data (how you will do it). A separate guideline will be distributed at the beginning of the course.\nProject Presentation: Week 8 (Dec 11 ‚Äì Dec 13), class time.\n\n\nLate policy\nTo keep all students on a relatively level playing field, a late assignment will be accepted up until one week after the original due date for a loss of a half-letter grade (e.g., an A becomes an A-). After one week, late assignments will receive no credit and will not be accepted.\n\n\nSoftware\nWe use R and R Studio as the coding environment to develop analysis and applications. You can install the software on your personal computers from here and here.\n\n\nCommunication\nPlan on using our class Slack channel, email, and office hours to get help with troubleshooting problems as they arise in your work. I also encourage you to work with others in the class to troubleshoot problems - it is highly likely that others in the class have encountered similar problems, and this also allows us to create a repository of our problems and responses.\nEmail: I check emails quite frequently, but I will not always be able to respond to emails right away. Please plan accordingly so that you don‚Äôt miss deadlines.\nSlack: We have a Slack workspace that is accessible through Canvas for general communication, including homework Q&A, resource exchange, project collaboration, etc.\nOffice hours: Please consult the top of the syllabus for specific times. I will announce if there are any changes or exceptions. I‚Äôm happy to answer any specific coding questions, or chat and help shape the objective and scope of your projects.\n\n\nEthics\nAcademic Integrity:¬†Violations to academic integrity are unacceptable at MIT and DUSP.¬†Instances of misconduct include but are not limited to plagiarism, cheating, deliberately unauthorized use of course data and material.\nCollaboration Policy:¬†While team collaboration is encouraged, students should specify their role and tasks in a project. A positive and constructive attitude for teamwork is essential for a successful completion of the course.\nDiversity and Inclusion:¬†MIT highly values a diverse, friendly, respectful, and inclusive learning environment among students, faculty, and staff. We welcome all individuals regardless of their origin, citizenship, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious and pollical beliefs. Please contact me or departmental staff if you have any question / consideration regarding this."
